			<h1><strong>&egrave;</strong></h1>
			<h2>grave accent</h2>
			<p>
				A mark placed over certain letters in some languages to indicate an alteration of a sound, as of quality, quantity, or pitch. Example: citt&agrave; means city in Italian, and is pronounced sit-ah, with an accent on the second syllable.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&eacute;</strong></h1>
			<h2>accent acute</h2>
			<p>
				The acute accent (sometimes called accento chiuso, &ldquo;closed accent&rdquo; in Italian) is compulsory only in words of more than one syllable stressed on their final vowel (and a few other words). Words ending in stressed -o are never marked with an
				acute accent (&oacute;), but with a grave accent (&ograve;). Therefore, only &eacute; and è are normally contrasted, typically in words ending in -ch&eacute;, such as perch&eacute; (&ldquo;why/because&rdquo;);
			</p>

			<h1><strong>&ecirc;</strong></h1>
			<h2>circumflex</h2>
			<p>
				The circumflex is a diacritic in the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic scripts that is used in the written forms of many languages and in various romanization and transcription schemes. It received its English name from Latin circumflexus &ldquo;bent around&rdquo;
				– a translation of the Greek &#960;&#949;&rho;&#953;&#963;&#960;&#969;&mu;&#941;&nu;&#951; (perisp&omacr;m&eacute;n&emacr;). Portuguese &acirc;, &ecirc;, and &ocirc; are stressed &ldquo;closed&rdquo; vowels, opposed to their open counterparts &aacute;,
				&eacute;, and &oacute;.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&euml;</strong></h1>
			<h2>umlaut or diaerisis</h2>
			<p>
				In linguistics, umlaut (from German &ldquo;sound alteration&rdquo;) is a sound change in which a vowel is pronounced more like a following vowel or semivowel. Example: Das M&auml;dchen ist d&uuml;nn und sch&ouml;n.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&ccedil;</strong></h1>
			<h2>cedilla</h2>
			<p>
				It was first used for the sound of the voiceless alveolar affricate /ts/ in old Spanish and stems from the Visigothic form of the letter &ldquo;z&rdquo; (&#658;), whose upper loop was lengthened and reinterpreted as a &ldquo;c&rdquo;, whereas its lower
				loop became the diminished appendage, the cedilla.
				<br> It represents the &ldquo;soft&rdquo; sound /s/, the voiceless alveolar sibilant, where a &ldquo;c&rdquo; would normally represent the &ldquo;hard" sound /k/ (before &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;o&rdquo;, &ldquo;u&rdquo;, or at the end of a word) in English
				and in certain Romance languages such as Catalan, Galician, French (where &ccedil; appears in the name of the language itself, fran&ccedil;ais), Ligurian, Occitan, and Portuguese.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&ntilde;</strong></h1>
			<h2>tilde</h2>
			<p>
				The name of the character came into English from Spanish, which in turn came from the Latin titulus, meaning &ldquo;title&rdquo; or &ldquo;superscription&rdquo;. This symbol (in English) informally means &ldquo;approximately&rdquo;, such as: &ldquo;&#126;30
				minutes before&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;approximately 30 minutes before&rdquo;. It can mean &ldquo;similar to&rdquo;, including &ldquo;of the same order of magnitude as&rdquo;, such as: &ldquo;x &#126; y&rdquo; meaning that x and y are of the same order
				of magnitude.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&oslash;</strong></h1>
			<h2>streg</h2>
			<p>
				The name of this letter is the same as the sound it represents. Though not its native name, among English-speaking typographers the symbol may be called a &ldquo;slashed o&rdquo; or &ldquo;o with stroke&rdquo;. Although these names suggest it is a ligature
				or a diacritical variant of the letter o, it is considered a separate letter in Norwegian and Danish, and it is alphabetized after &ldquo;z&rdquo;—thus z, &aelig;, &oslash;, and &aring;.
				<br> In modern Danish, Faroese, and Norwegian, the letter is a monophthongal close-mid front rounded vowel, the IPA symbol for which is also [&oslash;]. As with so many vowels, it has slight variations of &ldquo;light&rdquo; quality (in Danish, s&oslash;ster
				(&ldquo;sister&rdquo;) is pronounced as [&oslash;], like the &ldquo;eu&rdquo; in the French word bleu) and &ldquo;dark&rdquo; quality (in Danish, b&oslash;nne (&ldquo;bean&rdquo;) is pronounced as [&oelig;], like the &ldquo;&oelig;u" in the French
				word b&oelig;uf).
			</p>

			<h1><strong>&eth;</strong></h1>
			<h2>eth</h2>
			<p>
				Eth (uppercase: &ETH;, lowercase: &eth;; also spelled edh or e&eth;) is a letter used in Old English, Middle English, Icelandic, Faroese (in which it is called edd), and Elfdalian. It was also used in Scandinavia during the Middle Ages but was subsequently
				replaced with dh and later d. It is often transliterated as d (and d- is rarely used as a mnemonic). The lowercase version has been adopted to represent a voiced dental fricative in the International Phonetic Alphabet.
				<br> A capital eth is used as the currency symbol for <a href="http://dogecoin.com/">Dogecoin</a>.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&aring;</strong></h1>
			<h2>bolle</h2>
			<p>
				Though &Aring; is derived from an A with a ring, it is considered a separate letter. It developed as a form of semi-ligature of an A with a smaller o above it to denote a long and darker A, similar to how the umlaut mark that distinguishes &Auml; from
				A, and &Ouml;/&Oslash; from O, developed from a small e written above the letter in question.
				<br> Before 1917, when spelling with the double A was common, some Norwegian place names contained three or four consecutive A letters: for instance Haaa (now H&aring;a, a river) and Blaaaasen (Bl&aring;&aring;sen, &lquo;the bl&aring;/blue &aring;s/ridge&rquo;).
			</p>

		<section>
			<h1><strong>&aelig;</strong></h1>
			<h2>ligature</h2>
			<p>
				&AElig; (minuscule: &aelig;) is a grapheme named &aelig;sc or ash, formed from the letters a and e, originally a ligature representing a Latin diphthong. It has been promoted to the full status of a letter in the alphabets of some languages, including
				Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, and Faroese.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&#339;</strong></h1>
			<h2>ligature</h2>
			<p>
				&#339; A number of words written with &#339; were borrowed into English from Latin, but the &#339; is now rarely written. In modern American English, the sound is usually written as e, so diarrh&#339;a has become diarrhea, although there are some exceptions
				such as phoenix. In modern British English the spellings generally keep the o but remove the ligature (e.g. diarrhoea).
				<br> The &#339;, oe, or e is generally pronounced /iː/ in syllables with word stress, or /&#603;/ when unstressed.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&emacr;</strong></h1>
			<h2>macron</h2>
			<p>
				&emacr; A macron (/&apos;m&aelig;kr&#594;n, &apos;me&#618;-/) is a diacritical mark, a straight bar (&macr;) placed above a letter, usually a vowel. Its name derives from the Greek &mu;&alpha;&kappa;&rho;&#972;&nu; (makr&oacute;n), meaning &ldquo;long&rdquo;,
				and was originally used to mark long or heavy syllables in Greco-Roman metrics. It now more often marks a long vowel.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&ccaron;</strong></h1>
			<h2>h&aacute;&ccaron;ek or caron</h2>
			<p>
				Different disciplines generally call this diacritic by different names. Typography tends to use the term caron. Linguistics more often uses ha&ccaron;ek (with no long mark), largely due to the influence of the Prague School (particularly on Structuralist
				linguists who subsequently developed alphabets for previously unwritten languages of the Americas).
				<br> &Ccaron;/&ccaron; (similar to &#712;ch&#712; in cheap: &Ccaron;eskoslovensko, which means Czechoslovakia)
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h1><strong>&ubreve;</strong></h1>
			<h2>crescent or breve</h2>
			<p>
				&Ubreve; or &ubreve; is a letter in the Esperanto alphabet, based on u. It is also used in the Belarusian language, when written in the 20th-century form of the Belarusian Latin alphabet. The accent mark (diacritic) is known as a breve.
				<br> In some philological transcriptions of Latin, &ldquo;&ubreve;&rdquo; denotes a short U — for example, &ldquo;f&ubreve;g&omacr;&rdquo; ([&#712;f&#650;ɡoː], to chase away), vs &ldquo;f&umacr;m&omacr;&rdquo; ([&#712;fuːmoː], to smoke).
